As an Fullstack Engineer, I have dedicated my career to helping Innovative Startups provide value for users with thoughtfully engineered products. With a strong background in Software Engineering, I specialize in React Native mobile development both targeting Android and iOS operating systems. 

Throughout my professional journey as an Engineer, I have had the opportunity to play a key part in the development of successful mobile projects such as the DogeCoin-2.0, Kwara, Kilimanjaro, and Betprotect mobile Apps, among others. I have worked and collaborated with Software teams across Europe, North America, and Australia, employing both Agile/Scrum and Waterfall methodologies. My commitment to building scalable and performant software has allowed me to develop a unique perspective and a versatile skill set that I continuously strive to apply and expand.
